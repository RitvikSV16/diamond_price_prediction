# Diamond Price Prediction

Welcome to the Diamond Price Prediction repository! This project aims to predict diamond prices through a meticulous blend of data exploration, transformation, and machine learning techniques. Our journey unfolds with insightful discoveries and impactful decisions that shape the course of predictive analytics.

## Highlights

- **Insights Unveiled:** Delve into the rich landscape of diamond data, where we uncover hidden patterns and correlations that fuel our predictive models.

- **Multicollinearity Tamed:** Embrace the power of the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) as we gracefully harmonize correlated variables, paving the way for a robust and accurate model.

- **Model Mastery:** Witness the synergy of Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Linear Regression, where we meticulously craft and optimize predictive models that lay bare the true essence of diamond pricing.
